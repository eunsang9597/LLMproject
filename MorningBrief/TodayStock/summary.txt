Microsoft's stock has worst day in two years after disappointing forecastMicrosoft shares fell more than 6% on Thursday after guidance fell short of analysts’ estimates.
It’s the steepest drop since October 2022.
For the quarter that ended in September, revenue increased 16%, topping estimates.Microsoft
’s better-than-expected earnings report wasn’t enough to prevent the stock’s steepest sell-off in two years, as investors instead focused on the company’s forecast for the current period.
Microsoft shares fell 6% on Thursday and headed for their worst day since Oct. 26, 2022, when they dropped 7.7%. That was a month before the public release of ChatGPT from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, a launch that set the stage for a boom in artificial intelligence investments.
For the period ending in December, Microsoft called for revenue in the range of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion, implying 10.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $69.83 billion in revenue.
Revenue in Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure business, Azure, increased 33%. CFO Amy Hood said on a call with analysts that growth, in constant currency, will come in at 31% to 32% in the fiscal second quarter.
On Tuesday, Google
reported 35% annual growth in its rival cloud business to $11.35 billion. Amazon
, which leads the cloud infrastructure market, is scheduled to report results after the close on Thursday.
“We view Q1 results as solid across the core Azure and Office growth businesses, though tempered by a softer Q2 outlook,” analysts at BofA Global Research wrote in a report on Thursday. They still recommend buying the stock.
Fiscal first-quarter revenue increased 16% from a year earlier to $65.59 billion, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $64.51 billion, according to LSEG. Earnings per share of $3.30 topped the $3.10 average estimate.
Net income rose 11% to $24.67 billion from $22.29 billion in the year-ago quarter.Outside suppliers are late in delivering data center infrastructure to Microsoft, meaning the company won’t be able to meet demand in the fiscal second quarter.
“I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply-demand will match up,” CEO Satya Nadella said on the earnings call.
Microsoft’s AI investments continue to be a major focus for investors, as the company builds out its infrastructure and ramps up chip spending to handle heftier workloads. Microsoft has invested close to $14 billion in OpenAI, which was valued at $157 billion in a financing round earlier this month.
Hood said on the call she expects the company to take a $1.5 billion hit to income in the current period, mainly because of an expected loss from its investment in the AI startup.
Meanwhile, spending on property and equipment grew 50% year over year to $14.92 billion. The consensus among analysts polled by Capital IQ was $14.58 billion.
As of Thursday’s close, Microsoft shares were up a little over 8% for the year, while the Nasdaq has risen 21% during the same period.

’s massive investment in OpenAI is weighing on earnings.
Following Microsoft’s quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, CFO Amy Hood said she expects the company to take a $1.5 billion hit to income in the current period, mainly because of an expected loss from OpenAI.
Microsoft has invested close to $14 billion in OpenAI, whose ChatGPT assistant has gone viral and inspired a whole new industry called generative artificial intelligence. The trend has generated billions of dollars in new revenue for Microsoft.
But OpenAI is losing bundles of cash. The company expects $5 billion in losses this year, before stock-based compensation, on $4 billion in revenue, The Information reported earlier this month, citing documents.
Hood said that for Microsoft, the loss is accounted for under the equity method. The accounting approach refers to a company’s share of the invested company’s profit or loss in a given period, a Microsoft spokesperson said.
The additional detail is “not due to a change in our partnership or investment in OpenAI,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our partnership with OpenAI continues to deliver results, as we build differentiated IP and drive revenue momentum.”
The earnings call came after Microsoft reported an earnings and revenue beat for the fiscal first quarter. However, the stock slid in extended trading after the company’s forecast called for slower-than-expected growth.
While OpenAI is a central part of Microsoft’s growth strategy, the company has been hedging its bets after integrating OpenAI’s models into several products and acting as the startup’s exclusive cloud infrastructure provider. On Tuesday, Microsoft’s GitHub subsidiary said it would allow developers to power the Copilot Chat feature with models from Google
or startup Anthropic instead of OpenAI’s GPT-4o.
In addition to the $13 billion Microsoft had invested in OpenAI as of Sept. 30, the company put in another $750 million in a funding round announced in October, which valued OpenAI at $157 billion.
Microsoft rivals are playing a similar game. Amazon
, most notably, has invested $4 billion in AI model company Anthropic, whose founders previously worked at OpenAI. Amazon reports earnings on Thursday.
The OpenAI investment disclosure was new for Microsoft, but the company has registered over $2.3 billion in other expense in the past four quarters. That number has factored in the investment in OpenAI, the spokesperson said.
On the earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the collaboration with OpenAI has benefited both parties and that the company feels good about “our investment stake in OpenAI.”
OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

WATCH: Oppenheimer downgrades Microsoft: OpenAI losses are not properly priced inOpenAI launches ChatGPT search, competing with Google and MicrosoftOpenAI on Thursday launched ChatGPT search, positioning the company to better compete with search engines like Google, Microsoft’s Bing and Perplexity.
In July, OpenAI announced it was beta-testing a prototype of the search engine, called SearchGPT, and now it’s officially rolled the product into ChatGPT.
The feature offers up-to-the-minute sports scores, stock quotes, news, weather and more, powered by real-time web search and partnerships with news and data providers.
The news comes after OpenAI closed its buzzy funding round earlier this month at a valuation of $157 billion, and also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit.OpenAI on Thursday launched a search feature within ChatGPT, its viral chatbot, that positions the high-powered artificial intelligence startup to better compete with search engines like Google
, Microsoft
’s Bing and Perplexity.
ChatGPT search offers up-to-the-minute sports scores, stock quotes, news, weather and more, powered by real-time web search and partnerships with news and data providers, according to the company. It began beta-testing the search engine, called SearchGPT, in July.
The release could have implications for Google as the dominant search engine. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online. 
Shares of Alphabet were down about 1% following the news.The move also positions OpenAI as more of a competitor to Microsoft
and its businesses. Microsoft has invested close to $14 billion in OpenAI, yet OpenAI’s products directly compete with Microsoft’s AI and search tools, such as Copilot and Bing.
In a Reddit
AMA Thursday, OpenAI’s engineering VP, Srinivas Narayanan, answered a user question about whether ChatGPT search used Bing as the search engine behind the scenes, writing, “We use a set of services and Bing is an important one.”
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday in a post on X that search is his “favorite feature we have launched” in ChatGPT since the chatbot’s original debut.
OpenAI says users can “search in a more natural, intuitive way” and ask follow-up questions “just like you would in a conversation.” The search model is a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s most powerful AI model yet, GPT-4o, and is fueled in part by third-party search providers and content provided by news industry partners.
“I find it to be a way faster/easier way to get the information I’m looking for,” Altman said Thursday during the Reddit AMA. “I think we’ll see this especially for queries that require more complex research. I also look forward to a future where a search query can dynamically render a custom web page in response!”
OpenAI wrote in a Thursday blog post that it used feedback from its SearchGPT prototype to build out the feature and that it plans to “keep improving search, particularly in areas like shopping and travel, and leverage the reasoning capabilities of the OpenAI o1 series to do deeper research.”
ChatGPT will “automatically search the web based on what you ask,” according to an OpenAI blog post. Users can manually click the web search icon within ChatGPT to search if they choose.
Chats now include links to sources like articles or blog posts, which users can access by clicking the “Sources” button below the response to open a sidebar. OpenAI said it collaborated with its news partners, including The Associated Press, Reuters, Axel Springer, Condé Nast, Hearst, Dotdash Meredith, the Financial Times, News Corp., Le Monde, The Atlantic, Time and Vox Media.All ChatGPT Plus and Team users, as well as members of SearchGPT’s waitlist, can access ChatGPT search starting Thursday, according to an OpenAI blog post. ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the next few weeks, and the product will roll out to users of ChatGPT’s free version “over the coming months,” per OpenAI.
OpenAI closed its latest funding round earlier this month at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and Big Tech companies. It also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion. OpenAI expects about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue this year, CNBC confirmed in September with a person familiar with the situation.
OpenAI has in recent months experienced some controversy around its upcoming transition to a for-profit structure, as well as a string of executive departures. Jan Leike, a former safety team leader at the company, wrote on X while resigning that “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products” at the company.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services was up 33%, surpassing estimates.
Guidance for revenue growth fell short of expectations.Microsoft
 reported an earnings and revenue beat for the fiscal first quarter on Wednesday, but the stock slid 4% in extended trading after the company’s forecast called for slower growth than expected.
Here’s how the company performed, compared with analysts’ expectations based on a survey by LSEG: 
Earnings per share: $3.30 vs. $3.10 expected
Revenue: $65.59 billion vs. $64.51 billion expected
Revenue increased 16% year over year in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, according to a statement. Net income rose 11% to $24.67 billion from $22.29 billion in the year-ago quarter.
For the current quarter, Microsoft called for revenue in the range of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion. That implies 10.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $69.83 billion in revenue.
Outside suppliers are late in delivering data center infrastructure to Microsoft, meaning the company won’t be able to meet demand in the fiscal second quarter.
“I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply-demand will match up,” CEO Satya Nadella said on a conference call with analysts.
In August, Microsoft said it would revise the reporting of business segments to reflect its management approach. Mobility and security services, along with some Windows revenue, are now part of the productivity and business processes unit, which includes Office software.
Revenue from productivity and business processes rose 12% to $28.32 billion in the quarter, topping the $27.9 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. It’s 38% higher than the $20.45 billion midpoint of the forecast that management gave in July, because the actual total accounts for the changes.
Investors received a clearer picture of cloud computing consumption at Microsoft. For the first time, the Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric excludes mobility and security and Power BI data analytics sales. Azure growth for the quarter came in at 33%, or 34% at constant currency, with 12 points coming from artificial intelligence services. CNBC’s consensus for Azure growth was 32.8%, while StreetAccount’s was 29.4%.
“Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity,” Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, said on the call.
Hood called for 31% to 32% Azure growth at constant currency for the fiscal second quarter.
The full intelligent cloud segment, including Azure, Windows Server and enterprise services, generated $24.09 billion in revenue. That’s up 20% and slightly more than the $24.04 StreetAccount consensus.
On Tuesday, Google
reported 35% annual growth in its rival cloud business to $11.35 billion. Amazon
, which leads the cloud infrastructure market, is scheduled to report results Thursday.
Microsoft has shrunken the size of its segment called more personal computing through the reporting changes. In the latest quarter, it contributed $13.18 billion in revenue, up about 17% from a yeaer earlier and above the $12.56 billion StreetAccount consensus.The company saw 2% growth in sales of devices and sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Industry researcher Gartner estimated that quarterly PC shipments declined 1.3%.
Microsoft’s AI investments continue to be a major focus for investors, as the company builds out its infrastructure and ramps up chip spending to handle heftier workloads. Microsoft is the main investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which was valued at $157 billion in a financing round earlier this month.
As of Sept. 30, Microsoft had racked up more than $108 billion in finance leases that had not started, which UBS analysts have said might include third-party cloud spending to meet AI demand.
At the same time, Microsoft has been spending more cash on property and equipment. In the first quarter, spending grew 50% year over year to $14.92 billion. The consensus among analysts polled by Capital IQ was $14.58 billion.
As of Wednesday’s close, Microsoft was up about 15% for the year, while the Nasdaq gained around 24% during the same period.

has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.
GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a statement Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s
Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.
“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the statement. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”
Microsoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.
OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.
The arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a drop-down menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google
, Dohmke said.
Developers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.Many other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.
In February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring Mustafa Suleyman, a co-founder of DeepMind, and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.
In the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.
“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.
Also on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.

Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing rival chipmaker IntelNvidia is replacing Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup that reflects a massive change in the semiconductor industry.
Nvidia shares have gained more than 170% this year, while Intel has lost over half its value.
The last change to the index came in February, when fellow tech giant Amazon was added to the Dow.Nvidia
is replacing rival chipmaker Intel
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that reflects the boom in artificial intelligence and a major shift in the semiconductor industry.
Intel shares were down 1% in extended trading on Friday. Nvidia shares rose 1%.
The switch will take place on Nov. 8. Also, Sherwin Williams

. in the index, S&P Dow Jones said in a statement.
Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple
among publicly traded companies.
Companies including Microsoft,
Meta
, Google
and Amazon
are purchasing Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), such as the H100, in massive quantities to build clusters of computers for their AI work. Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and has at least tripled in three of them. The company has sginaled that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane.”
With the addition of Nvidia, four of the six trillion-dollar tech companies are now in the index. The two not in the Dow are Alphabet and Meta.
While Nvidia has been soaring, Intel has been slumping. Long the dominant maker of PC chips, Intel has lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices
and has made very little headway in AI. Intel shares have fallen by more than half this year as the company struggles with manufacturing challenges and new competition for its central processors.
Intel said in a filing this week that the board’s audit and finance committee approved cost and capital reduction activities, including lowering head count by 16,500 employees and reducing its real estate footprint. The job cuts were originally announced in August.
The Dow contains 30 components and is weighted by the share price of the individual stocks instead of total market value. Nvidia put itself in better position to join the index in May, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While doing nothing to its market cap, the move slashed the price of each share by 90%, allowing the company to become a part of the Dow without having too heavy a weighting.
The switch is the first change to the index since February, when Amazon
replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance
. Over the years, the Dow has been playing catchup in gaining exposure to the largest technology companies. The stocks in the index are chosen by a committee from S&P Dow Jones Indices.

WATCH: Nvidia leaps and bounds ahead of AMDHigher taxes will make it harder for Britain to build ‘the next Nvidia,’ tech execs sayTechnology entrepreneurs and investors slammed the U.K. government’s decision to hike capital gains tax, National Insurance contributions and carried interest for VC fund managers.
U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves announced a move to raise CGT as part of a far-reaching announcement on the Labour government’s fiscal spending and tax plans.
Haakon Overli, co-founder of venture capital firm Dawn Capital, said the tax increases could make it harder for the next Nvidia to be built in the U.K.LONDON — British tech bosses and venture capitalists are questioning whether the country can deliver on its bid to become a global artificial intelligence hub after the government set out plans to increase taxes on businesses.
On Wednesday, Finance Minister Rachel Reeves announced a move to hike capital gains tax (CGT) — a levy on the profit investors make from the sale of an investment — as part of a far-reaching announcement on the Labour government’s fiscal spending and tax plans.
The lower capital gains tax rate was increased to 18% from 10%, while the higher rate climbed to 24% from 20%. Reeves said the increases will help bring in £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) of additional capital to the public purses.
It was also announced that the lifetime limit for business asset disposal relief (BADR) — which offers entrepreneurs a reduced rate on the level of tax paid on capital gains resulting from the sale of all or part of a company — would sit at £1 million.
She added that the rate of CGT applied to entrepreneurs using the BADR scheme will increase to 14% in 2025 and to 18% a year later. Still, Reeves said the U.K. would still have the lowest capital gains tax rate of any European G7 economy.The hikes were less severe than previously feared — but the push toward a higher tax environment for corporates stoked the concern of several tech executives and investors, with many suggesting the move would lead to higher inflation and a slowdown in hiring.
On top of increases to CGT, the government also raised the rate of National Insurance (NI) contributions, a tax on earnings. Reeves forecasted the move would raise £25 billion per year — by far the largest revenue raising measure in a raft of pledges that were made Wednesday.
Paul Taylor, CEO and co-founder of fintech firm Thought Machine, said that hike to NI rates would lead to an additional £800,000 in payroll spending for his business.
“This is a significant amount for companies like us, which rely on investor capital and already face cost pressures and targets,” he noted.
“Nearly all emerging tech businesses run on investor capital, and this increase sets them back on their path to profitability,” added Taylor, who sits on the lobbying group Unicorn Council for U.K. FinTech. “The U.S. startup and entrepreneurial environment is a model of where the U.K. needs to be.”Another increase to taxation by way of a rise in the tax rate for carried interest — the level of tax applied to the share of profit a fund manager makes from a private equity investment.Reeves announced that the rate of tax on carried interest, which is charged on capital gains, would rise to 32%, up from 28% currently.
Haakon Overli, co-founder of European venture capital firm Dawn Capital, said that increases to capital gains tax could make it harder for the next Nvidia to be built in the U.K.
“If we are to have the next NVIDIA built in the UK, it will come from a company born from venture capital investment,” Overli said by email.
“The tax returns from creating such a company, which is worth more than the FTSE 100 put together, would dwarf any gains from increasing the take from venture capital today.”
The government is carrying out further consultation with industry stakeholders on plans to up taxes on carried interest. Anne Glover, CEO of venture capital firm Amadeus Capital, said this was a good thing.
 “The Chancellor has clearly listened to some of the concerns of investors and business leaders,” she said, adding that talks on carried interest reforms must be “equally as productive and engaged.”
Britain also committed to mobilizing £70 billion of investment through the recently formed National Wealth Fund — a state-backed investment platform modelled on sovereign wealth vehicles such as Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.This, Glover added, “aligns with our belief that investment in technology will ultimately lead to long term growth.”
She nevertheless urged the government to look seriously at mandating that pension funds diversify their allocation to riskier assets like venture capital — a common ask from VCs to boost the U.K. tech sector.Steve Hare, CEO of accounting software firm Sage, said the budget would mean “significant challenges for UK businesses, especially SMBs, who will face the impact of rising employer National Insurance contributions and minimum wage increases in the months ahead.”
Even so, he added that many firms would still welcome the “longer-term certainty and clarity provided, allowing them to plan and adapt effectively.”
Meanwhile, Sean Reddington, founder and CEO of educational technology firm Thrive, said that higher CGT rates mean tech entrepreneurs will face “greater costs when selling assets,” while the rise in employer NI contributions “could impact hiring decisions.”
“For a sustainable business environment, government support must go beyond these fiscal changes,” Reddington said. “While clearer tax communication is positive, it’s unlikely to offset the pressures of heightened taxation and rising debt on small businesses and the self-employed.”
He added, “The crucial question is how businesses can maintain profitability with increased costs. Government support is essential to offset these new burdens and ensure the UK’s entrepreneurial spirit continues to thrive.”
Adam French, a partner at seed-stage investors Antler, was less downbeat on Reeves’ tax plans, saying the impact of the changes on the U.K. tech ecosystem “will be modest at best.”
“I don’t think this will make much difference to the U.K.’s entrepreneurial scene at all,” French told CNBC via email. “If this prompts a huge exodus of founders to other shores, I’d be very surprised. I think the community here is much more resilient than that.” Higher taxes will make it harder for Britain to build ‘the next Nvidia,’ tech execs sayTechnology entrepreneurs and investors slammed the U.K. government’s decision to hike capital gains tax, National Insurance contributions and carried interest for VC fund managers.

Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and Nvidia outlined plans to build AI infrastructure in India.
Nvidia also announced Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi 4B, a small language model in Hindi — the widest-spoken of India’s multitude of languages.Nvidia
on Thursday announced a slew of partnerships with major Indian firms and launched a Hindi language model, as the American chip company looks to ramp up business in one of the world’s biggest technology markets.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke about the firm’s tech and efforts in India at its AI Summit in Mumbai — an event that featured Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar and India’s richest person Mukesh Ambani, the chair of Reliance Industries
.
Amid the flurry of partnerships announced on the occasion was a deal between Reliance and Nvidia to build AI infrastructure in India. Huang said that Nvidia is working with companies including Yotta and Tata Communications
to also build computing infrastructure. Huang said that by the end of the year, India will have “20 times more compute” than just over a year ago, referring to the country’s computing power.“India used to be a country that produced software. [India] exported software. In the future, India is going to export AI,” Huang said.
Nvidia also announced Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi 4B — a small language model in Hindi, the widest-spoken of India’s multitude of languages. Companies running Nvidia hardware can deploy this language model, while Indian IT consultancy Tech Mahindra
is using Nvidia’s model to launch its own Hindi AI model, Project Indus 2.0.
Small language models are trained on much more compact and specific datasets compared to large language models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4. 
Nvidia is also collaborating with other major Indian IT companies like Infosys, Wipro and TCS to train around 500,000 developers in creating and implementing AI agents with its software.
Nvidia’s ramp-up in India takes place as the company looks to find new regions to boost business, while the breakneck speed growth it has experienced over the last year and a half begins to slow down.
In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been looking to lure in major foreign technology companies, particularly in the semiconductor industry, to increase investment in the country.
India aims to establish itself as a major player in the semiconductor industry, as it strives for self-sufficiency in manufacturing. Modi has outlined various objectives to advance the semiconductor sector, setting a significant target to grow the country’s electronics industry from its current value of around $155 billion to $500 billion by 2030.
“India is very, very dear to the world’s computer industry, central to the IT industry,” Huang said.
Ambani’s presence at the Nvidia event also highlighted his conglomerate’s ambition to become a leading AI player in India. Reliance Jio, the telecommunications firm under Ambani’s Reliance Industries and an upstart less than a decade ago, is now India’s biggest mobile provider.
“Jio aims to build large scale AI infrastructure to democratize AI leveraging data emanating from almost a billion Internet users in next few years. With this planned investments and scale, Jio aims to be the flag bearer of proliferating AI adoption from consumers to enterprises to government,” Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.

1. The S&P 500
was trying to break a three-session losing streak. Stocks were given some relief from lower bond yields, which have been recently rising despite the Fed’s monetary easing. Bond traders have been pushing yields up, signaling central bankers were too heavy-handed with September’s jumbo half-point interest rate cut.
2. Tesla
shares were jumping 14.5% and leading the Nasdaq
toward a higher open after the EV maker beat on quarterly earnings per share (EPS). While missing on revenue, Elon Musk’s prediction of 20% to 30% “vehicle growth” next year sparked investor buying. He cited “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.”

1. The S&P 500
was trying to break a three-session losing streak. Stocks were given some relief from lower bond yields, which have been recently rising despite the Fed’s monetary easing. Bond traders have been pushing yields up, signaling central bankers were too heavy-handed with September’s jumbo half-point interest rate cut.
2. Tesla
shares were jumping 14.5% and leading the Nasdaq
toward a higher open after the EV maker beat on quarterly earnings per share (EPS). While missing on revenue, Elon Musk’s prediction of 20% to 30% “vehicle growth” next year sparked investor buying. He cited “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.”

Chinese EV maker BYD’s quarterly sales overtook Tesla’s for the first timeOn Wednesday, BYD reported revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 of 201.12 billion yuan ($28.24 billion), up 24% from a year ago.
That exceeded Tesla’s revenue of $25.18 billion reported for the same period.
The milestone comes amid tough competition in China, the world’s largest auto market, as well as higher tariffs on imports of Chinese EVs into the European Union.Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD
reported third-quarter revenue that topped that of behemoth rival Tesla
for the first time.
On Wednesday, BYD reported revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 of 201.12 billion yuan ($28.24 billion), up 24% from a year ago. That exceeded Tesla’s revenue of $25.18 billion reported for the same period.
It’s a first for the Beijing-based EV giant as its solid performance came despite the EV downtrend in mainland China. The company sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August.
At least half of BYD’s sales are hybrid vehicles, whereas Tesla’s vehicles are battery only.But in terms of net profit, Tesla still took the lead.
The American carmaker saw net profit of $2.18 billion from July to September, up 16.2% from a year ago. Its Chinese counterpart, BYD, saw an increase in profit of 11.5% in the same period to 11.6 billion yuan.
Likewise, Tesla remains on top in year-to-date sales, slightly edging out BYD’s roughly $70.53 billion total revenue at $71.98 billion.
BYD is one of the most prominent EV makers in China, the world’s largest automotive market where it must contend with both domestic and global rivals for dominance.
On BYD’s home turf, Elon Musk’s Tesla is one of its toughest competitors. The Model Y remained the best-selling battery-powered electric car in China in September, according to Chinese automotive website Autohome. BYD’s Seagull trailed closely behind in second place.
The competition will likely only get more cut-throat as European Union tariffs came into effect this week, despite China’s disapproval.
On Wednesday, the EU announced it would implement tariff increases on Chinese EVs, taking duties to as high as 45.3%.
The extra tariffs range from 7.8% for Tesla to 35.3% for SAIC Motors
, which will stack on top of a 10% standard import duty on all electric vehicles.While tariffs imposed on BYD and Tesla were reduced from an earlier proposal, both automakers have taken steps to ramp up production in Europe which would help them work around the duties.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Tesla got the green light to double the capacity of its Berlin plant.
And BYD announced last year it would set up shop in Hungary. In July, the Chinese automaker said it would invest $1 billion into a plant in Turkey, which has a customs union with the EU.— CNBC’s Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.Chinese EV maker BYD’s quarterly sales overtook Tesla’s for the first timeOn Wednesday, BYD reported revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 of 201.12 billion yuan ($28.24 billion), up 24% from a year ago.

The two-day pop comes after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and CEO Elon Musk offered an optimistic projection for 2025.
Tesla shares are still 34% below their 2021 record.A day after its sharpest rally since 2013, Tesla’s
stock on Friday closed at its highest in more than a year as investors and analysts continued to applaud the electric vehicle company’s third-quarter results.
Tesla shares rose 3.4% on Friday to $269.23, its highest finish since September 2023. With the two days of gains, the stock erased its loss for the year and is now up 8.4% in 2024, still trailing the Nasdaq’s 23% increase.
Analysts at Piper Sandler were the latest to bolster their price target following Wednesday’s earnings report. The firm, which already had a buy rating on the stock, said it was increasing its 12-month stock price prediction to $315 from $310 “to reflect higher deliveries and higher margins.”
Tesla shares on Thursday soared 22%, their second-best performance since the company’s IPO in 2010. That came after Tesla reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which just missed analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.
Tesla’s profit margins were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which JPMorgan Chase analysts noted in a report were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow. Results were also boosted by $326 million in revenue from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. 
CEO Elon Musk said on the earnings call that his “best guess” is that vehicle growth will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing lower-cost vehicles and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.
When it comes to autonomy, however, Musk has consistently missed his own deadlines for getting products to market. Bernstein analysts wrote in a note after earnings that Musk has a “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD,” adding that research shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.
Musk also said on the call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He said Tesla would conduct driverless ride-hailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.
With the two-day rally, Musk has now increased his paper wealth by roughly $30 billion, bringing his total net worth to about $274 billion, according to Forbes. That puts him more than $60 billion ahead of the world’s second-richest person, Oracle
founder Larry Ellison, who is a former Tesla board member and a good friend of Musk’s.
Still, Tesla’s stock remains 34% below its all-time high reached in 2021. The company had a brutal first quarter of 2024, with year-over-year deliveries falling and consumers flocking to EVs from a host of competitors.
The competitive risks remain.
In China, companies such as BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers such as Li Auto and Nio, have been ramping up sales. In the U.S., legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are starting to sell more electric vehicles, despite walking back prior electrification commitments.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.
Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.
Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”
CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.
Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.
It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.
A grain of salt

He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.
Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”
Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 
The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”
They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.
The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO
